# chrome-time-tracker

Created a nice little Google Chrome extension that tracks how long the user is spending on each website. For it to work you need to input your own website names to the user interface once it is installed. I would recommend just the base of some website, as you might navigate to other pages from there but you want it to all count to the same total.

Once that is done you can start (doom)scrolling!
